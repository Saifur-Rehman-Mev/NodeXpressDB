NodeXpressDB is a powerful and efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. This project demonstrates seamless backend operations by integrating Express for routing, MongoDB for NoSQL database management, and Node.js for server-side execution. 
I only focused on the parsing request and displaying data through EJS and storing data in MongoDB database.
Not focused on styling
